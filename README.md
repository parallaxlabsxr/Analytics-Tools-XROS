# Analytics Tools XROS
A toolkit to help with collection of analytics inside VR in a privacy-friendly way.

# Basic Information
VR Analytical Toolkit is a virtual reality plugin/toolkit that has the
capabilities of tracking various virtual input actions and log them in
an anonymous privacy-friendly manner. The plugin should be able to
track the amount of time spent looking at places with the headset,
The amount of time spent using one particular input etc. The
analytics would be then outputted in a privacy-friendly format which
would be readable and analyzable outside of our game engine. The
analytics can also be displayed as heatmaps and such inside of our
game engine.

# Technology
Game Engine - Unity (Knowledge of VR implementations and
basic know-how of logging inside Unity)
Hardware - Meta Quest 2 and above (Preferable)
